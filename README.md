# JetsProject

## Description
### This program allows you to pay with a list of flying entities and perform various tasks with them, as well as add to and remove entities from the list. To use the program, simply follow the on screen prompts.

### All of my "jets" are named after flying animals, and their statistics are based on their actual capabilities in nature and otherwise.

## Technology Used
###Abstract class, interfaces, for loops, switches, while loops, nested if statements/for loops, text readers, array lists, wrapper classes, overridden methods

## Lessons Learned
### This project taught me a lot about scope, which seems to be my biggest struggle so far. The program helped me to understand that where object are declared, assigned, and instantiated can make very significant differences depending on the location of the action. I also learned how to better structure my classes, methods, and interfaces; however, I still have a lot of work to do on that front.
